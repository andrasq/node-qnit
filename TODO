- read cmdline options from test/qnit.opts? (like mocha, for eg -t 5000)

- setup/teardown: handle done(err) by logging error and unit test location (not "uncaught error" trace of internal location)

- report eg "var not defined" errors that occur inside tests (as opposed to MongoError: Connection Closed By Application)
  (also "call stack exceeded", which is what it was I believe)

- mocha runs each inner `describe` clause with its own copy of the surrounding scope ?!

- mocha "done" callback is optional, and is only called if provided

- make require('qnit') work from inside a unit test file, to access eg qnit.qmock from mocha-style tests
