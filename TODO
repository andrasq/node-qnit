- read cmdline options from test/qnit.opts? (like mocha, for eg -t 5000)

- setup/teardown: handle done(err) by logging error and unit test location (not "uncaught error" trace of internal location)

- report eg "var not defined" errors that occur inside tests (as opposed to MongoError: Connection Closed By Application)
  (also "call stack exceeded", which is what it was I believe)

- mocha runs each inner `describe` clause with its own copy of the surrounding scope ?!

- mocha compat: it.only to run only that test (ie, only those tagged "only")
- mocha compat: this.timeout() to control per-test timeout

- fixme: if test is ^Z suspended for more than 2000 (-t) milliseconds, the "did not call done" error is printed
  but the test is still run to completion, instead of being aborted

- fixme: throws(fn, msg) does not test that the err.message contains msg, it passes with any message
